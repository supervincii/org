* Q1: Fundamentals & C Programming

** C Basics and Computer Architecture Introduction

*** Resources
- C Programming: A Modern Approach by K.N. King
- Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective by Bryant and O'Hallaron
  
*** Project: Memory Visualizer in C
Create a tool that visualizes how data is stored in memory.

Requirements:
- Implement functions to allocate various data types (int, char, float, arrays, structs).
- Display memory addresses and content in a formatted, readable way.
- Show how complex structures are laid out in memory.
- Visualize stack vs heap allocation
- Demonstrate pointer arithmetic and its effects.
- Include documentation explaining memory concepts illustrated by the tool.
  
Input: Function calls to allocate and manipulate data.
Output: Visual representation of memory layout with addresses and content.

** Computer Architecture & Memory Management 

*** Resources
- Continue with CS:APP
- Understanding and Using C Pointers by Richard Reese

*** Project: CPU Simulator in C
Build a program that simulates the execution of a simplified instruction set architecture.

Requirements:
- Implement a register file with at least 8 general-purpose registers.
- Support basic operations: ADD, SUB, LOAD, STORE, JUMP, BRANCH.
- Include a program counter and instruction memory.
- Support sequential execution of a program loaded from a file.
- Implement memory addressing modes (direct, indirect, indexed).
- Provide debugging features showing register state after each instruction.
- Handle basic error conditions (invalid opcodes, memory access violations).

Input: Assembly-like text file with instructions.
Output: Register state after each instruction execution and final memory state.

** Operating Systems Fundamentals

*** Resources
- Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces by Remzi H. Arpaci-Dusseau
- The Linux Programming Interface

*** Project: Command-line Shell in C
Create a shell that can execute commands and manage processes

Requirements:
- Support executing external programs with fork() and exec()
- Implement built-in commands: cd, pwd, echo, exit, history
- Handle input/output redirection (>, <, >>)
- Support pipes (|) to connect multiple commands
- Implement background process execution with &
- Manage a history of executed commands with recall functionality
- Handle signals (Ctrl+C, Ctrl+Z) appropriately
- Implement proper error handling and reporting

Input: User-entered command lines.
Output: Execution results of commands and appropriate shell prompts.

** File Systems and I/O

*** Resources
- Continue with OSTEP
- Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment by W. Richard Stevens

*** Project: Virtual File System in C
Implement a simplified file system that supports basic file operations.

Requirements:
- Create an in-memory file system with directories and files
- Support operations: create, delete, read, write, list, move
- Implement proper file descriptors and file table
- Add basic permission system (read/write/execute)
- Support file metadata (creation time, modification time, size)
- Implement persistent storage by saving to a disk file
- Include error handling for common file system errors
- Add simple journaling for crash recovery

Input: File system operation commands
Output: Operation results and file system state

** Basic Data Structures Implementation

*** Resources
- Mastering Algorithms with C by Kyle Loudon
- Algorithms in C by Robert Sedgewick

*** Project: Data Structures Library in C
Build a comprehensive library of fundamental data structures with testing.

Requirements:
- Implement: Linked list (singly and doubly linked), Stack, Queue, Binary search tree, Hash table
- Each structure should support standard operations (insert, delete, search)
- Design a consistent API across all data structures
- Implement generic versions using void pointers and function pointers for comparisons
- Include memory management (proper allocation/deallocation)
- Write comprehensive test cases for each data structure
- Document the time and space complexity of each operation
- Implement serialization/deserialization for persistent storage

Input: Library API calls
Output: Operation results and structure state

** Algorithm Implementation and Analysis

*** Resources
- Introduction to Algorithms by CLRS
- The Algorithm Design Manual by Steven Skiena

*** Project: Pathfinding Visualization in C
Create a tool that visualizes different pathfinding algorithms.

Requirements:
- Implement BFS, DFS, Dijkstra's algorithm, and A* search
- Create a grid-based environment with obstacles
- Visualize the search process showing explored nodes (using a simple text-based or basic graphical output)
- Allow users to place start, end points, and obstacles
- Calculate and display performance metrics (nodes explored, path length, time)
- Support different heuristics for A*
- Implement a map file format for saving and loading grid configurations
- Compare algorithm performance across different scenarios

Input: Grid configurations and algorithm selection
Output: Visual representation of the search process and resulting path
